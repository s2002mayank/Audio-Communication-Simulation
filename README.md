# Real-time Audio-Communication-Simulation

It involved designing a multi-threaded simulation of real-time audio communication that efficiently fills and empties a shared buffer simultaneously from either end. The recording thread captures audio and stores it in the buffer, while the playback thread retrieves and plays the audio. This process involved complex thread synchronization to ensure data integrity and smooth operation, providing hands-on experience with threading models and buffer management in a real-time system.
